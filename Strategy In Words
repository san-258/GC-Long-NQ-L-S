Here is the plain English breakdown of your 3-Strategy Portfolio:

1. GC_LONG: "The Lazy Hunter"
Goal: Catch massive multi-day trends in Gold while barely looking at the screen.
The Vibe Check (Filter): Before doing anything, check the 1-Hour Chart. Is the price above the 10 EMA line? If yes, we are in a valid uptrend.
The Entry (5-min chart):
We wait for the price to be comfortably trending up (above the 10 EMA).
We look for a Red Candle (a temporary dip/pullback).
We place a "Buy Order" just above the High of that red candle.
Logic: We don't buy the dip blindly. We wait for the price to break back UP above the dip, confirming the trend is resuming.
The Exit (15-min chart):
We hold the trade as long as the 15-minute candles stay above the 20 EMA line.
We Sell to Close the moment a 15-minute candle closes below that 20 EMA line.
Why? The 20 EMA on a 15m chart is a "loose leash." It lets Gold wiggle and shake without kicking you out, allowing you to ride huge moves.
2. NQ_LONG: "The Momentum Surfer"
Goal: Capture the aggressive rallies in Tech stocks (Nasdaq).
The Vibe Check (Filter): 1-Hour Chart must be above the 10 EMA. Upside momentum only.
The Entry (5-min chart):
Same as Gold. Wait for a Red Candle (pullback) while trending up.
Buy if price breaks the High of that red candle.
The Exit (15-min chart):
We hold as long as price stays above the 10 EMA.
We Sell to Close when a 15-minute candle closes below the 10 EMA.
Why? Nasdaq is faster and jerkier than Gold. We use a "tighter leash" (10 EMA vs 20 EMA) to lock in profits faster before it snaps back.
3. NQ_SHORT: "The Widowmaker"
Goal: Profit from panic. Stocks fall faster than they rise ("Stairs up, Elevator down").
The Vibe Check (Filter): 1-Hour Chart must be BELOW the 10 EMA. We only short when the big picture looks ugly.
The Entry (5-min chart):
We wait for the price to be trending DOWN (below 10 EMA).
We look for a Green Candle (a relief bounce).
We place a "Sell Short Order" just below the Low of that green candle.
Logic: We bet that the bounce will fail. If price breaks the low of the green candle, the selling panic is back on.
The Exit (5-min chart - FAST):
We hold only as long as the 5-minute candles stay below the 10 EMA.
We Buy to Cover (Exit) the second a 5-minute candle closes above the 10 EMA.
Why? Short squeezes kill accounts. We do NOT give this trade room to breathe. We get in, ride the flush, and get out the moment momentum slows down.
